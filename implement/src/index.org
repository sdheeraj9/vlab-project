* Goal

The Goal of this course is to walk you through an end-to-end
requirements specification, design, development and
deployment of a small web application.  In the process, you
will learn to use various technologies and will be
introduced to well-established processes and good software
development practices that we use here at VLEAD.

* Components of a web application
A /web application/ consists of a collection of continuously
running programs possibly running on different machines,
connected, and geographically distant from each other.
(Such programs are called services.)  On the user's
machine's end is a program running inside the /web browser/
which displays the output of the application as well as
functions as an interface for the user to send information
to the application.

The server side of the application runs as a thread inside a
/web server/.  The job of the web server is to listen for
inputs, get the server side web application thread to
compute an output and then serve that output back to the
user's browser.
 
The web application usually has a third component, which is
a /database/.  The database stores data needed by the
application.  The database allows the data to survive even
if the application stops.

The data items in the database are related to one another.
The types of the data and the relations between them and the
operations permitted on the data items are expressed using a
/data model/.

The web application allows access to its underlying data via
/URL addresses/ (sometime along with form fields).  The
specification of the mapping of the urls to operations on
the data is called a /REST API/. 

* Software Development Life Cycle  (SDLC)

A systematic development of the application requires that we
break down the entire realization of the application into
multiple, intertwined phases.  In this short course, our
application life cycle will include the following phases:
